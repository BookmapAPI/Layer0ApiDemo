# Bookmap Layer 0 API

## Overview
L0 API serves two main purposes:
* Replay your own file format with Bookmap.
* Connect Bookmap to your own datasource in real time (both for receiving data and trading)

Doing so requires basic Java knowlege, however file replay example that is available in this repository uses simple text format which you can convert data to using your favourite tools.

## Documentation

It's recommended to begin with this [getting started guide](doc/Layer0APIGettingstarted.pdf).
You might want to take a look at https://github.com/BookmapAPI/DemoStrategies#ide-and-tricks for more details about running your project from IDE - the process and the main caveats are similar.

After you install Bookmap javadoc will be available in C:\Program Files\Bookmap\lib\bm-l1api-javadoc.jar. You can also get it from Maven repository.
