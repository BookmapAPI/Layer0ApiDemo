# Bookmap Layer 0 API

## Overview
L0 API serves two main purposes:
* Replay your own file format with Bookmap.
* Connect Bookmap to your own datasource in real time (both for receiving data and trading)

Doing so requires basic Java knowlege, however file replay example that is available in this repository uses simple text format which you can convert data to using your favourite tools.

## Documentation

It's recommended to begin with this [getting started guide](doc/Layer0APIGettingstarted.pdf).

Also after you install Bookmap javadoc will be available in C:\Program Files\Bookmap\lib\bm-l1api-javadoc.jar (or C:\Program Files (x86)\Bookmap\lib\bm-l1api-javadoc.jar for x86 version).
